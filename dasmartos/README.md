### Project Status

Finished codecademy's version. Would like to create a version of my own which will render the text next to the image of
the product. This may posibly make the website look more appealing.

### Room for Improvement

__Todo:__
+ Render text next to the image for a possible better site appeal  (think flex-box in CSS)
+ Create a mobile version  (think media queries)
+ Pictures of the Website - edit in photoshop to crop/cut out the edges and change the size in bytes of the pciture file.

### Sources/Acknowledgements
