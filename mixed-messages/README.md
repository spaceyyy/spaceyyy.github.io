## Introduction

This is codecademy's first project done on your own environment compared to using their platform. The aim of this project is to create a quote generator that displays quotes on the user's web browser. The original project was to be ran on a Node script, but an extra credit option of using html and displaying the project on a web browser can also be used. Link for the quote generator: [quote-generator](https://spaceyyy.github.io/quote-generator.html)

### Project Status

Currently in progress. Would like to redo with another programmer or a group of programmers to simulate working on a team.

### Room for Improvement

__Todo:__  
+ Add a text input for the user to add in their own quotes.
+ Add functionality to allow the user to save favorite quotes
+ Better design (think color and font theory)
