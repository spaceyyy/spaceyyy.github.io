## Introduction

A choose and click adventure game introduced from Codecademy's website that takes the user throughout a journey. A journey through different doors, but also a journey learning multiple coding languages. Can you navigate throughout the game and 
choose the proper door towards freedom and safety, or will the Choordoor Bot bring you to justice. (Justice in it's eyes
atleast.) Link for the Choor Door Game: [choor-door](https://spaceyyy.github.io/choreDoorGame/choreDoor.html)

### Sources/Acknowledgements

Thanks to Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp for their lessons on HTML and CSS to gain knowledge to understand, recreate, and create a version of your own for this project. I also would like to
thank Google for the countless hours saved through Chrome Developer Tools for debugging purposes.
I also received a leg up through the Head First book Series.
