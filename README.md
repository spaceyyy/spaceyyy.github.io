## Introduction
 
 Hi Everyone! My name's Mickey and welcome to my Github Page. This project was inspired by Codecademy's Full Stack
 Path Program. I've decided to use this page to display projects/files that I have worked on throughout my coding
 journey. Hopefully in the future I will have my own domain where I can transfer these projects too and eventually
 create my own personal portfolio web page! Link for github pages: [github-page](https://spaceyyy.github.io/)
